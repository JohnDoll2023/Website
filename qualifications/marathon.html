                <h5>The Marathon Petroleum Corporation invites rising talents to participate in its Explorers Program which has multiple facets. I was able to be a part of both the IT
                    Explorers Program and the Engineering Explorers Program. I particpated my senior year of high school from the fall to the early spring. Sessions were held weekly 
                    at Marathon headquarters in Findlay, Ohio. The building was on tight security protocols so unfortunately I have no images of what we accomplished. For one of the engineering events,
                    we were split into competing teams and given limited supplies to build the tallest roller coaster that we could for a set of marbles. I can't remember all the specifics of 
                    how ours turned out, but I remember being disappointed that we didn't win after we worked really hard. It was very competitive and a really fun experience that I was happy to be 
                    a part of. For another event, we worked with Arduino boards which I had never used before in my life. We matched up the wires to pass signals through and turn on a
                    bulb. This inspired me to take up Computer Engineering at Miami as learning the behind the scenes was really cool. We also attended several seminars presented by people
                    in the industry who would share their knowledge of machine learning, high performance computing, and server builds. For me, this experience as a whole was huge. In
                    high school, I was only offered a select few (three, I believe) engineering courses that were not initially available when I was a freshman. I was able to take Introduction
                    to Engineering my senior year which was great, but it wasn't the computer science or computer engineering experience I was hoping for as it was more focused on design using
                    tools like SolidWorks. This Marathon program allowed me to branch out and deepen my love for computers which was limited to me in high school.
