                <p>Miami University (Fall 2019 - Spring 2023)</p>
                <h5>With high school graduation approaching, I started to get nervous about how much I was going to enjoy college. I'd tell my parents that I wasn't sure
                    that college could top high school even though I had been committed to Miami basically since birth. I had an absolutely tremendous time in high school, especially my
                    senior year. I loved all the relationships I had, and I was a part of so much fun throughout my four years. I thought there was no way college could compare. I was wrong.
                    I couldn't be happier to be a (now former) student at Miami. Even with the pandemic, I have been having the time of my life at this university. I have incredible friends that I spend
                    all my time with when I'm not busy studying. Computer Science is no easy task at Miami, and I'm grateful to learn as much as I can before my years in college are completed. I have
                    taken an incredible course load every semseter, packing in as much information as possible. My easiest semester (before I decided to relax at the end of senior year) in terms of the number of credit hours was my very first semester when I took
                    Calculus II and Physics I together which is a choice I would not make again as it may have been my hardest semester in terms of content. <br><br>

                <h5><br>Something I'm most proud of at Miami was my ability to rebound. I began my first semester with a 3.32 GPA with which I was satisfied. I wouldn't necessarily say
                    it was a shock, but it was different since I maintained a 4.0 in high school. Since that first semester though, I raised my GPA just about every single semester and graduated with a 3.76
                    and a 3.95 in the Computer Science department. I got knocked down a bit first semester; I fell into the bucket of kids that takes a semester to adjust. I used
                    that as motivation though to ensure that I better understood the courses I was taking. I know that grades don't matter if you aren't learning anything, so I took it 
                    to heart to learn the topics we cover each week and put them into practice. I have a very strong passion for understanding, especially when it comes to how things work.
                    I am still the same six year old always asking "Why?" that I was over 15 years ago. In fact, I still ask my parents so many questions that it is a running joke
                    now that when I return home from school or work that I will have a list of questions to ask them.

                <h5>In the Fall of 2020, I volunteered and was lucky enough to be selected as an Undergraudate Associate for Ms. Keisha Norris's section of Computing, Engineering, and Society (CEC 101).
                    Two other UA's (who happened to be my friends) and I were responsible for most things outside the classroom except for grading. We would host weekly office hours on Zoom as all
                    classes at Miami were virtual for that semester. We would have a few kids show up, and we actually became friends with a couple of them which was awesome; I'm still friends with them
                    today. It was nice to be on the other side of the things as the "instructor" for once just to gain a new perspective. It has helped me to better understand and connect with my 
                    professors as I now know the struggles they face and as a student have more to offer to the professor having taken a position similar to theirs. Other responsbilities we had as 
                    UA's was creating and distributing weekly newsletters with topics ranging from the class specifically to university-wide events. Additionally, we were "buddies" with the first-year
                    students as they got accustomed to college life during the COVID era. I feel like we were able to have a stronger impact this particular year as opposed to others because the students
                    were having an extremely tough time getting connected to others and finding resources that on-campus students would have no trouble doing. This was one of the most rewarding parts of 
                    the position as I personally was able to help students find their way through their first semester at Miami.

                <h5>I was recommended for the Honors Ambassador position by several faculty members after I attended a recruiting event with my sister, who was a senior in high school at the time. I, a
                    student in just my first semester, was with her along with my parents to more or less hang out and get to see each other again. However, as the social event moved along, I found myself talking to 
                    prospective students, telling them my experiences and recommending that they come to Miami. The two Chief Departmental Advisors (CDA) of my two majors at the time were there as well as
                    my honors advisor. They noticed me "doing a much better job of recruiting" than they were doing, and we had a good laugh about it. I ended up getting <i>invited</i> back to the event
                    the three following weeks and was extended an offer as an Honors Ambassador - a position otherwise reserved for second-year students. The beginning of my work as an ambassador was largely online
                    due to the pandemic where I was a part of group and one-on-one sessions with prospective students and their families. Things returned to in-person my junior and senior year where I was a part of a 
                    panel every Friday that we hosted an honors information session. I was also a part of the morning breakfast mixer where I would talk to prospective students and their families about my experiences 
                    and guide them where they needed to be in our student center. For my last panel, I wore a special Mickey Mouse hat for fun and it ended up being the day that <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CrB-dG5r6aH/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==" target="_blank">the university photographer was there.</a>

                <h5>I applied for, interviewed, and was accepted onto the Honors Student Advisory Board (HSAB) in my first semester. On the board, I was a member of the health and wellness
                    team each semester where I contributed to events and activities such as intramurals, newsletters, meditations, and yoga sessions. A big topic on the plate of HSAB is Miami's
                    transition of the Honors Program to the Honors College. Almost every meeting, we discussed details regarding the new college and how it will be run and what we thought was best
                    going forward. It was an amazing adventure to contribute ideas on such a big project by the university. Being on the board has been quite beneficial as an Honors Ambassador as I have 
                    "insider information" and am well versed in how the college will be operating. This is just one of many ways I use my experiences in cross-disciplinary ways to enhance my and other's time
                    while at Miami.

                <h5>My path through college had so many twists and turns just academically that even I'm not sure I can recall everything. I graduated from Wapakoneta High
                    School, and the plan was to major in Computer Science and Computer Engineering. About a month later, I ran the calculations for three days and decided that I was going to add a major
                    in Predictive Analytics. I was thrilled. As I've mentioned before, I love to learn, and this was going to be a lot of learning. Well, one meeting with my academic advisor was enough
                    to get me to drop Computer Engineering. Back to a double major. For a day. The very next day I decided I was going to be a triple major again, this time with Software Engineering. 
                    I would go on to keep these three majors for a year. Then came the flood of minors. I added Statistics and Bioinformatics as minors at the end of my first semester of college. I 
                    also added and dropped another minor over the course of a week which I cannot remember anymore. At this point, I was a triple major with a double minor. First semester Sophomore year 
                    rolled around, and I was taking STA 401 Probability. Turns out Predictive Analytics and Statistics weren't for me, and so I switched my focus to CS. By dropping both of these which I do 
                    still care about, just not enough to focus studies on them, I was now able to put a much larger focus on expanding my knowledge base in CS. Flash forward one semester, and I'm a double major with one minor. I'm taking
                    Intro to Software Engineering (Software Engineering major) and Biological Concepts (Bioinformatics minor). The semester ends, and I realize the opportunity cost of taking biology classes over computer science courses 
                    was too large, so I dropped the Bioinformatics minor. As far as Software Engineering goes, having the major proved to restrict me to a too rigid schedule and I wanted more flexibility. So while I love Software Engineering, I
                    had to drop the major so I could take other Computer Science classes that I really care about. I still took courses for both majors, but came up just a few credits short on the Software Engineering major.
                    Once again, I love learning, and it was nice to dip my toes in the water for all of these different areas of study. Ultimately, I realized I really just want to focus on CS. And that 
                    is how I spent my last four semesters at college. I took a wide variety of CS courses, and I loved every minute of it. I also took a few courses outside of CS that I really enjoyed. Senior year was especially great
                    as I was able to pretty much choose my CS classes at my leisure and also take some fun electives outside of CS like rocking climbing and ice hockey. 
                    <br><br>
                    My year-long senior design project was to build a machine learning model and system that would automatically detect and recogize license plates entering and exiting a parking garage. The university sponsored this 
                    project as they are looking to find a much cheaper alternative for parking garage access than the current system. The current system is through an annual contract costing over $1,000,000 which is on top of each of
                    the $10,000 cameras that are installed in each garage and on several golf carts they drive around to check for parking passes. Our budget was $150 and with this, we were able to create the system with one 
                    camera that was attached to a Raspberry Pi. The system was able to detect and recognize license plates in real time and then send the data to a database. The system was also able to detect and read the characters on the
                    license plate. We had users set up that could sign up with their plate and see their entry and exit log. We also had admins that could see and correct all of the data and add/remove users. I am real proud of my team and our
                    success on the project. At the senior design expo, we placed 2nd out of over 30 teams.
