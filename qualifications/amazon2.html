                            This internship in the Summer of 2022 marked my second internship with Amazon. My <a href="amazon.html" target="_blank">first</a> was the previous summer in Seattle working on Amazon Go technology. This summer, I switched
                            locations to Silicon Valley and switched teams to <a href="https://github.com/deepjavalibrary/djl" target="_blank">Deep Java Library (DJL)</a>.

                    Both of my internships with Amazon have been great for me in different ways. Last summer, it was the opportunity to see how companies managed large codebases and how they worked through the agile process.
                    For this internship, I was able to vastly improve my problem solving skills by working on an open source project that my team manages, the Deep Java Library.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Having never worked on an open source project before, especially not one of this magnitude, I had to do a lot of problem solving individually. DJL has only been around for a couple years now, so
                    there aren't a lot of internet resources to help me solve issues with it. If I did find errors, I had to fix them myself, as reporting them would've just sent them right back to my team and to me.
                    This forced me to really dig deep, which I somewhat came to appreciate because I had to find a solution before I could move on. I became more resourceful, using many more tools available to me and 
                    extending their uses beyond what I had before.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    For my project this summer, I was able to use DJL to develop three Android demo apps that ran deep learning inference on the phone being used. My apps would download the deep learning model, take 
                    the input from the user specific to that app, run the inference locally, and return the results to the user. The first app that I built was <a href="https://github.com/deepjavalibrary/djl-demo/tree/master/android/pytorch_android/semantic_segmentation" target="_blank">Semantic Segmentation</a>, an app that colors in objects that it
                    detects in pictures, a technology used often in self driving vehicles. The second app that I built is <a href="https://github.com/deepjavalibrary/djl-demo/tree/master/android/pytorch_android/neural_machine_translation" target="_blank">Neural Machine Translation</a>, an app that converted French user input text to English using the context
                    to help translate the words. The third app that I built is <a href="https://github.com/deepjavalibrary/djl-demo/pull/245" target="_blank">Speech Recogntion</a>, an app that transcribes audio that a user speaks to it. On top of all these, I was able to help update documentation and fix 
                    various bugs in order to improve DJL. Additionally, I was able to release a blog about Semantic Segmentation on TowardsAI, a branch off of Medium.

                    Everyone likes to talk about how great the weather in California is, but it is part of the reason I don't want to return. My entire summer, it did not rain once, so as someone who enjoys rain and
                    thunderstorms, this was sad. Also, the Bay Area is windy every single day which is not something they advertise. I love to play a lot of sports and run, and this isn't that easy when you always
                    have to fight 20+ mph winds. To be fair, I did catch a lot of sun which I appreciated. I'm sure a lot of people love the Bay Area weather, but it isn't for me.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    What was for me was the amount of friends I made this summer and the amount of places we saw. Every single weekend, my friends and I went to a new location in the Bay and soaked it all in. I was able to 
                    travel to Yosemite, Los Angeles, and Santa Cruz to name a few. I crossed a couple items off the bucket list when we went skydiving, surfing, and crossed the Golden Gate Bridge among other things. I like
                    to think that this summer was more of a vacation with work on the side. I really do think this was the best summer I've ever had because of the things I did and the people I was with. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The summer prior in Seattle was my first using public transportation, but this summer I became an absolute master. Seattle is generally walkable from the city, but the Bay Area is massive. Every weekend
                    I was taking this train or that train to connect to this bus or that bus and even took a few ferries and trolleys to make my way around. Something I really liked was how interconnected all the South Bay towns
                    were. Sunnyvale, Mountain View, Santa Clara, Cupertino, Palo Alto, they all run together from one to the other and they all have a nice small town feel just like in Wapakoneta where I grew up. If I wanted the
                    big city feel, San Jose was right next to me, and San Francisco and Oakland were only a train ride a way.
