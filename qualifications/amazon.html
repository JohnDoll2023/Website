                            Working at Amazon as a Software Developer Engineer Intern was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. I had the opportunity to meet so many people of all walks of life, live in a brand new city all on my own, and complete
                            a meaningful project at one of the most well-known companies in the world.

                <h5>
                    This experience easily provided the most growth for me in a professional manner more than any other experience has before. I was able to look at and work with Amazon's code base and pipelines 
                    and see how a large company manages such a large infrastructure of code. I was able to directly interact with this when I was working on my project, an internal website to help connect customer
                    service agents with developers when customers were having issues with <a href="https://justwalkout.com/" target="_blank">Just Walk Out (JWO)</a> shopping trips.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The website I was able to create is confidential but I can touch on what technology I got to use to build it. I pulled together my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery and Ajax in order to 
                    build the entire front end dashboard display as well as the back end functionality in making API calls and parsing the data. I had to deal with issues such as Cross-Site Scripting and making
                    sure my project was secure with multi-factor authentication and authorization mechanisms. Overall, I got to design pretty much the entire thing. My team gave me some requirements at the beginning
                    of the summer, and it was my job to fit the requirements in any way possible. I spent about the first half of my project on design, writing no code, and the back half of my internship actually
                    working on the implementation and testing of website. I was able to deploy my project to production in my final week and see it get put to use just before I left which was extemely rewarding.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Not only did I get to see what it was like to be a professional developer, but I was able to see what it was like working in a professional environment. I went in to work with my team nearly
                    everyday which I loved because I felt that I was a more efficient worker when I had others around me. I was able to get past obstacles more quickly with people around to help me. Having others
                    around also meant I got to hear and watch them solve the problems they were running in to, which gave me a better idea of how to troubleshoot myself. I picked up on and learned many small things 
                    that I do not believe I would have gotten from working in a virtual environment and am very happy with my choice to choose the hybrid option to work in Seattle.

                    It was a summer of many firsts for me. This summer marked my first time on a plane, living alone, living in a big city, renting an apartment, and doing all my own cooking and grocery
                    shopping. I felt mentally prepared to move from little Wapakoneta to the center of Seattle, and all things considered, I was not too shell-shocked by the big move. What really caught me
                    off guard was how different the work environment was at Amazon compared to my previous internship. Going from an office of about 20 people to a building meant for a couple thousand was
                    hard for me to comprehend. It is still hard for me to wrap my head around this summer as a whole. It doesn't feel real to say that I interned across the country in Seattle working 
                    for Amazon. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I am very grateful for my hybrid experience because I was still able to go into the office and work with other Amazonians such as fellow interns and members of my team. Being able to work
                    in-person with my team everyday was probably the most enjoyable part of my whole summer. Eating and socializing with the team and always having people to count on and give me advice made
                    going to work everyday something I looked forward to. Additionally, since I was hybrid, I was not required to work with the team which meant I was able to work with hundreds of other
                    interns across the 50 building Amazon campus. All-in-all, I worked in 20 different Amazon offices over the course of my internship which made for a great time.

                    <br>
                    During my first week in Seattle, I created a list of all the places and attactions I wanted to visit, and of the 15 or so, I was able to do all but 2. I, of course, made it to the Space Needle
                    a couple times, the Woodland Park Zoo, the Seattle Aquarium, Mount Rainer, the Pike Place Market, and many Seattle Mariners games. Without a car in Seattle, I had to rely on public transportation which 
                    was pretty brand new to me. Sure, I went the wrong way or took the wrong bus a couple times, but I was able to utilize all five of their transportation systems at least once. I regularly rode
                    the light-link rail and the bus for reaching the attractions, as well as the street car, the monorail and the ferry for other fun adventures.
