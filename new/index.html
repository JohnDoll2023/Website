                    supporting me in the form of students, teachers and administration. I really could not have asked for a better year. I got to do so many things and have so many great
                    opportunities that it's too hard to keep track.

                <h5>My being late was not my fault, alright. Listen, my sister and a couple other kids were waiting to get picked up by the bus freshman year at 6:40
                    a.m. or something, too early whatever it was. Anyway, we saw the bus coming so we lined up to get on, and then we watched as the bus went by and never stopped
                    for us. This had never happened before so we kind of just stood there for a few minutes waiting for it to circle back. It took a phone call and several
                    transfers before another bus came and picked us up. We got to school a few minutes late and walked into the office expecting a pass to class since we 
                    were only several minutes late at this point but nope. Tardy. Dude what? The bus forgot to get us then; we had to call you to pick us up! Whatever, I don't think 
                    about it at night anymore, so it's fine. As for the day absent, my three best friends and I all contracted the flu at the same time, and so I missed a Monday
                    of school in February of my sophomore year. I hardly ever get sick, and I'm usually one to tough out my allergies, so this was a big day for me.<br><br>
                    I was huge into clubs and sports in high school. I wanted to do as much as I could, and some might say I was too involved as my time was spread thin, but
                    I made it to nearly every event we had. I played tennis, ran cross country, and was on the academic team. <a href="https://www.limaohio.com/sports/354537/boys-high-school-tennis-ottawa-glandorf-collects-wbl-tourney-overall-championships" target="_blank">I won the league championship at third singles</a> in
                    tennis my senior year. I was second-team all league my senior year in cross country. Academic team won the championship my freshman year, and I was MVP
                    both my junior and senior years. Overall, I had 11 seasons of varsity action (freshman tennis I was JV). <br><br>
                    Senior year was stellar. It seemed like all the good things you dream about happening happened to me over those nine short months. We cancelled ten days 
                    of school (snow, fog, <a href="https://www.limaohio.com/news/356307/auglaize-county-campground-evacuated-roadways-closed-after-flooding" target="_blank">flooding</a>). I went on 20 different field trips which I'm sure is a record that will never be broken. When you stack up the club activities,
                    field trips for honors classes, and sports postseason tournaments, you start to comprise a quality school year. I averaged about four days of school per week. Had
                    the district tennis tournament not been rescheduled, I would've missed my entire last week of school. I was nominated by my principal to be the rising scholar
                    from our high school for the <a href="https://www.limaohio.com/news/322497/wapaks-doll-making-sacrifices-for-his-future" target="_blank">newspaper</a>. 
                    <a href="https://twitter.com/wapakschools/status/1113598994679308288" target="_blank">I was awarded </a>the <a href="https://www.montpelier.k12.oh.us/userfiles/554/file/FranklinWalterPro.pdf" target="_blank">Franklin B. Walter Award</a>
                    for my exemplary character and academics. My team won review basketball in our anatomy class several times in a heated rivalry of window side vs wall side.

                <h5>If you ask just about anyone from high school what they remembered most about me, they would say Daily Tennis. What started as a simple way to keep my
                    friends and me accountable to play tennis everyday turned into an international phenomenon. <br><br>
                    It started on a summer night in June before junior year when our high school installed stadium lights around the courts. Over time, it evolved into an all
                    out production. On my Snapchat, we would post ridiculous videos of us doing something tennis related, and we'd get hundreds of views and loads of people
                    saying that they loved the content. We gained so much traction that teachers started requesting to be on it, then our principal, then the principals at
                    the next school over, then our superintendent, and arguably our biggest celebrity: our city mayor. I amassed so many followers in a short period of time,
                    and not just from Wapak, but around the world. I have followers from every continent now (except Antarctica). We had our own merchandise (two different shirts 
                    which sold nearly 100 units) and a whole page in the yearbook. The show ended the summer before my senior year, so we ran for about a year logging about
                    200 clips. It was certainly an incredible time. It was so incredible that when applying for college, my admissions representative actually wrote back 
                    regarding Daily Tennis as it had caught his attention. Look out for the app in late 2021!
