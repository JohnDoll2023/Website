                <p>Miami University (Fall 2019 - Spring 2023)</p>
                <h5>When high school graduation started to approach, I started to get nervous about how much I was going to enjoy college. I'd tell my parents that I wasn't sure
                    that college could top high school even though I had been committed to Miami since birth basically. I had an absolutely tremendous time in high school, especially
                    senior year. I loved all the relationships I had and I was a part of so much fun throughout my four years. I thought there was no way college could compare. I was wrong.
                    I couldn't be happier to be a student at Miami. Even with the pandemic, I have been having the time of my life at this place. I have incredible friends that I spend
                    all my time with when I'm not busy studying. Computer Science is no easy task at Miami, and I'm grateful to learn as much as I can before my years in college are up. I have
                    taken an incredible course load every semseter, packing in as much information as possible. My easist semester in terms of credits hours was my very first semester when I took
                    Calculus II and Physics I together which is a choice I would not make again as it may have been my hardest semester in terms of content. <br><br>

                <h5><br>Something I'm most proud of at Miami is my ability to rebound. I began my first semester with a 3.32 GPA which I was satisfied with. I wouldn't necessarily say
                    it was a shock, but it was different since I maintained a 4.0 in high school. Since that first semester though, I have raised my GPA every single semester and now post a 3.71
                    with a 3.97 in the Computer Science department. I got knocked down a bit first semester; I fell into the bucket of kids that takes a semester to adjust. I have used
                    this as motivation though, to ensure that I better understand the courses I am taking. I know that grades don't matter if you aren't learning anything, so I take it 
                    to heart to learn the topics we cover each week and put them into practice. I have a very strong passion for understanding, especially when it comes to how things work.
                    I am still the same six year old always asking "Why?" that I was nearly 15 years ago. In fact, I still ask my parents so many questions that it is a running joke
                    now that when I return home from school or work that I will have a list of questions to ask them.

                <h5>In Fall of 2021, I volunteered and was lucky enough to be selected as an Undergraudate Associate for Ms. Keisha Norris's section of Computing, Engineering, and Society (CEC 101).
                    Two other UA's (who happened to be my friends) and I were responsible for most things outside the classroom except for grading. We would host weekly office hours on Zoom as all
                    classes at Miami were virtual for this semester. We would have a few kids show up and we actually became friends with a couple of them which was awesome; I'm still friends with them
                    today. It was nice to be on the other side of the things as the "instructor" for once just to gain a new perspective. It has helped me to better understand and connect with my 
                    professors as I now know the struggles they face and as a student have more to offer to the professor having taken a position similar to theirs. Other responsbilities we had as 
                    UA's was creating and distributing weekly newsletters with topics ranging from the class specifically to university-wide events. Additionally, we were "buddies" with the first-year
                    students as they got accustomed to college life during the COVID era. I feel like we were able to have a stronger impact this particular year as opposed to others because the students
                    were having an extremely tough time getting connected to others and finding resources that on-campus students would have no trouble doing. This was one of the most rewarding parts of 
                    the position as I personally was able to help students find their way through their first semester at Miami.

                <h5>I was recommend for the Honors Ambassadors permission by several faculty members after I attended a recruiting event with my sister, who was a senior in high school at the time. I, a
                    student in just my first semester, was with her along with my parents to more or less hang out and get to see each other again. However, as the social event moved along, I found myself talking to 
                    prospective students, telling them my experiences and recommending they come to Miami. The two Chief Departmental Advisors (CDA) of my two majors at the time were there as well as
                    my honors advisor. They came to notice me "doing a much better job of recruiting" than they were and we had a good laugh about it. I ended up getting <i>invited</i> back to the event
                    the three following weeks and extended an offer as an Honors Ambassador - a position otherwise reserved for second year students. Since becoming an ambassador, COVID struck and
                    unfortunately many events have been cancelled and I have not hit my true potential yet. I have been a part of three events so far and have had just the best time in each of them.

                    team each semester where I contribute to events and activities such as intramurals, newsletters, meditations, and yoga sessions. A big topic on the plate of HSAB is Miami's
                    transition of the Honors Program to the Honors College. Just about every meeting, we discuss details regarding the new college and how it will be run and what we think is best
                    going forward. It has been an amazing adventure to chip in on such a big project by the university. Being on the board has been quite beneficial as an Honors Advisor as I have 
                    "insider information" and am well versed in how the college will be operating. This is just one of many ways I use my experiences in cross-disciplinary ways to enhance mine and other's time
                    while at Miami.

                <h5>My path through college has had so many twists and turns just academically (forget the pandemic!) that even I'm not sure I can recall everything. I graduated from Wapakoneta High
                    School and the plan was to major in Computer Science and Computer Engineering. About a month later, I ran the calculations for three days and decided that I was going to add a major
                    in Predictive Analytics. I was thrilled. As I've mentioned before, I love to learn, and this was going to be a lot of learning. Well, one meeting with my academic advisor was enough
                    to get me to drop Computer Engineering. Back to a double major. For a day. The very next day I decided I was going to be a triple major again, this time with Software Engineering. 
                    I would go on to keep these three majors for a year. Then came the flood of minors. I added Statistics and Bioinformatics as minors at the end of my first semester of college. I 
                    also added and dropped another minor over the course of a week which I cannot remember anymore. At
                    this point, I was a triple major with a double minor. You may be asking, as everyone was, why I was doing this to myself. I love to learn. I cannot explain it any more straight
                    than that. I want to know how things work and why they are the way they are. I believe this kind of thinking promotes better decision making. Anyway, first semester Sophomore year 
                    rolls around and I'm taking STA 401 Probability. Turns out Predictive Analytics and Statistics aren't for me and so I switch my focus to CS. By dropping both of these which I do 
                    still care about, just not enough to focus studies on them, I was now able to put a much larger focus on expanding my knowledge base in CS. Flash forward one semester and I'm a double major with one minor. I'm taking
                    Intro to Software Engineering (Software Engineering major) and Biological Concepts (Bioinformatics minor). The semester ends and I've dropped both Software Engineering and Bioinformatics.
                    Once again, I love learning, and it was nice to dip my toes in the water for all of these different areas of study. Ultimately, I realized I really just want to focus on CS. And that 
                    is how I will be spending my four remaining semesters of college. I expect to take at least 16 more Computer Science courses and also a few in Computer Engineering to test those waters as I was not able 
                    to get any scheduled earlier in my time at college.

                                300% from the previous record. I have had a wonderful time playing on and rooting for our teams and providing electric energy each week at chapter.
                                My best friends are from the fraternity and after school, this position is what I spend my most time on, upwards of 8-10 hours a week.
