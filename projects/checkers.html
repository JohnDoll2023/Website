                required the most thought and planning by far over previous projects. Also, it was fun because I literally got to make a game! I was a programmer. I knew this was what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. 
                I had fun downloading the code as .jar file and distributing it to my friends and family to show off what I had created. This fully functioning checkers game was my first big success in programming. I
                will admit after looking back on it that the code could use some work. Yeah it works, but the code is hardly readable. I've come a long way since my first year of college, and consequently, I know 
                better about creating an if statement that has over 20 conditions. But at the time, it was cool ("Carson, Mark, come look at how long this line of code is that I just wrote!").

                <h5>I'll admit that I also put off till the final weekend what was the biggest project of my life up to that point. It was a grind, but in one weekend I was able to pump out this project
                    with just under a year's worth of experience under my belt. The project requirement was only to create the checkerboard, making moving pieces was only for bonus. I always take every
                    bonus opportunity, and this was no exception. Getting the board to show up was the easy part. Getting the pieces to move AND disappear, now that took some thinking. Also, I made my
                    board resizable which was another significant challenge, not only for getting the graphics to properly adjust, but I also had to change how I received mouse clicking inputs, which I
                    didn't quite figure out all the way. You can download the game and play it for yourself <a href="Checkergame.jar" download = "Checkers">here</a>. You will likely have to open up your
                    security preferences to gain access to it as it costs lots of money to be an identified developer and unfortunately I am not one of those. I am open to donations if you would like to
                    help the cause; every bit counts.
