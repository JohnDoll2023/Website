                <h5>I've always been ambitious. As a result of this, I made a website after only having been exposed to HTML, CSS and JavaScript for less than half a semester.
                    This was both a blessing and a mistake. I learned quite a bit of information by starting this project with such little knowledge in the area. I went into the
                    project with absolutely zero knowledge about how to get a domain, how to find a host, how to link the two, and how to upload my corresponding files. I spent
                    about three days going from nothing to just getting "Hello, world!" to show up at <a href="../index.html">johnmdoll.com</a> when I wanted it to. Once I had 
                    that figured out, I went to work on brainstorming what I thought would be a decent user interface. I decided I wanted just the 5 main pages (displayed below)
                    with a corresponding navigation bar and footer and a cool background image. <br><br> There was only one problem: I didn't know Bootstrap. For those of you
                    who are unaware of what Bootstrap is, think of it this way. The tools I had at that time (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) were equivalent to using a screwdriver to put a 
                    screw in place. Bootstrap (also jQuery, AJAX, and PHP) pushes aside my screwdriver and gives me a drill to get my screw into place. It is a powerful tool for
                    web design that is integrated into many modern websites today. I could create the top navigation bar with just a few lines using
                    Bootstrap. This was going to take me quite some time without it as I'd have to create the feature from scratch. Not to mention the footer and also the spacing 
                    on the webpage were going to depend strictly on my ability to manuver around using HTML and CSS. <br><br>I got as far as getting my background image, header and footer.
                    Aside from the first page, all I really added was text that hyperlinked away from site to whatever resource or image I wanted my users to see. The plan was to 
                    create a much more appealing site like the one I have now, but after experiencing how tough it was to just make the top, bottom and background of my site, I
                    was starting to have second thoughts. I also knew that I was going to be taking Web Applications during my upcoming sophomore year, and having other projects
                    I wanted to focus on, I gave up the website until that class. I didn't get back to it until I decided that I was going to make a brand new site with the same
                    general design and user interface, but with a completely different structure of code since I now had the tools I needed to work very efficiently. Exhibit A: 
                    this webpage explaining my old site.
