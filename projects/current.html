                    <h5>I actually had the idea to make a new website shortly after beginning work on <a href="../projects/old.html" target="_blank"> my first site</a>. In case you haven't seen the run-down on my old website, here it is: 
                        I began working shortly after the end of my first year at Miami, having merely been exposed to <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/web-design-html-css-javascript" target="_blank">HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</a>. I had never heard of <a href="https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/web-development/what-is-bootstrap-a-beginners-guide/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a> or jQuery
                        or anything of the sort. All I knew was that HTML + CSS + JavaScript = website. I knew I was going to be taking Web Applications at Miami my sophomore year, and
                        expecting to learn more about web design, so I lost interest and began to focus on other projects. Now, at the time of writing this, my sophomore year has just ended
                        so here I am, developing this site. Keep reading for more about why this, why that and what I've picked up thus far.

                    a few lines in Bootstrap, after I had spent an entire day creating my own custom navigation bar way back when. Switching the navigation bar over to Bootstrap was about the first thing I did when writing up the
                    code behind this website. That and my footer, which I also built on my own way back when, and now simply create with Bootstrap. Also, the grid system. Several hours of work converted to minutes by 
                    beautiful Bootstrap. Enough about Bootstrap though, how is this website hosted?

                <h5><br class="mobile-break">Originally, I hosted my website using <a href="https://www.hostgator.com" target="_blank">HostGator</a>. 
                    It did the job just fine. I didn't realize it at the time, but it was much more expensive than other options out there. Upon getting my <a href="../qualifications/amazon.html" target="_blank">internship at Amazon</a>, 
                    I enrolled in a course they were offering on Amazon Web Services (AWS). I learned mostly surface level information which prepared me for the AWS Cloud Practitioner Exam. It touched on Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)
                    and Amazon Cloudfront. I didn't know it at the time, but my site would end up being hosted using those services. It took just one push from my Mentor at Amazon on the first Friday of my internship nudging me to use S3,
                    and the next day I was all over it. What I decided to do first was transfer my domain from Google Domains over to Amazon Route53, their DNS service. This turned out to be very useful because now, effectively all the
                    resources I was going to use were on AWS. What's more is that I decided I wanted to create some SSL/TLS certificates for my website, which is where Cloudfront and Amazon Certificate Manager come in. This took me 
                    just a bit but now as you can see, my website is secure. Transitioning to AWS was overall a very good move in retrospect because now all my services are in one hub and very conveniently interact with one another and
                    integrate seamlessly.

                    structured website I have today. At the time of writing, my website has content on the five main pages, and this is the first page outside of the original five that I have begun working
                    on. Once I develop every page to a satisfactory level, I'd like to go back and make enhancements and changes as I see fit. First, I want to create a good product that to your average person
                    looks pretty darn good. Then, I want to go back, tidy up, get rid of any existing bugs, and do some beautification, especially for the mobile end.
